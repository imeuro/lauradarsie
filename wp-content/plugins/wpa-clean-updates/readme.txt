WP Switch Clean Updates On assists in keeping WordPress websites clean after major version upgrades.

== Description == 

With every major update from WordPress, WordPress pushes new versions of her default themes to you server. Though the default themes are relatively safe, every line of unused code on your server forms a potential security risk. With this plugin your Websites will not be bothered with the new plugins. This plugin has only one short line of code, so it will hardly effect website speed and it will not litter your WordPress with advertising.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the complete wpa-clean-updates folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2. Go to the Plugins page and activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin slow down WordPress? =

The plugin just introduces a single setting to Wordpress in a single line of code. So no, it will not slow WordPress down.

= Is this plugin compatible with update management plugins? =

Yes. It has been tested by the guys over at Digishock.com and WebsiteNazorg.nl on various platforms. 

= What security considerations are there in using this plugin? =

This plugin is handling no user or system input/output. It does nothing with the database. It does however avoid your server from installing unneeded themes and so limiting the codebase on the server. Limiting the code base is a security best practice.

= Will there be future updates to this plugin? =

Yes, we will release a new version every 10 months. A new version will not mean new code. It is just to avoid the plugin being marked as abandoned. New code will only be added if Wordpress needs it.
